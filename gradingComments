Question 1: Algorithms. 10/10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - you're incrementing count for each successor, which will give
an inaccurate result. Better to make depth a member variable, and then child
depth=parent+1

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 15/15

count states: 5/5

Question 4: 10/10

Question 5: 10/10

97/100
